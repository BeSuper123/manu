        <div><p>
            <b>Barney Guttman</b> is one of the main characters in Dead End.<br><br> He is a gay transgender teen boy. <br><br> Zach Barack voices him.<br><br>
            Barney has family issues. His grandmother does not accept that he is transgender. We don't know 
            what his grandmother said to him, but it was shown to be extremely hurtful. <br>Barney's parents didn't help to defend 
            him in any way, causing him to run away with his dog, Pugsley. Barney and Pugsley stay at the Dead End attraction 
            with Courtney after getting a summer job as a security guard at Phoenix Parks. 
            <br>Barney is an extroverted and friendly boy who is very lively and positive.

        <div>
            <b>Norma Khan</b> is one of the main characters in Dead End.<br><br>She is a bisexual.<br><br>  Kody Kavitha voices her. <br><br>
            Norma is a more literal and introverted girl in general. When confronted with ghosts or demons, 
            Norma is more confident than Barney, though she is still afraid of them. Despite this, she frequently 
            takes charge when confronted with a potentially dangerous situation, such as when she approached a 
            riled-up Fingers in "Take the Angels Bowling." <br><br>On the other hand, she is extremely socially anxious, 
            dreading socializing and human contact, and has been shown to have panic attacks when overwhelmed.<br><br>
            
            Throughout most of the first season, she is obsessed with Pauline Phoenix and becomes overly excited 
            about anything involving the actress.

        <p><h2>Courtney</h2>
        <br>
        <img src="Images/courtney.jpg" alt="">

        <div>
            <b>Courtney</b> is one of main characters in Dead End. <br><br>Emily Osment voices the 
            1,000-year-old Demon who is later revealed to be a Fallen Angel.<br><br>
            Courtney was banished from Hell, possibly more than 500 years ago, but it has been suggested that she 
            was never there. She spent her days hiding in Phoenix Parks' haunted house, away from humans. <br><br>It is thought that before the first episode, 
            she made a deal with the demon lord Temeluchus, promising to bring him a flesh vessel in exchange for lifting her curse, 
            prompting her to create a phony job offer in order to lure clueless humans to the house by sundown.<br>
            Courtney is a sassy, insensitive, selfish, and good-natured demon.

        <p><h2>Pugsley Guttman</h2></p>

        <div><p>
            <b>Pugsley Guttman</b>, or simply <b>Pugsley</b>, was often included in Dead End: Paranormal Park. <br><br>

            Alex Brightman voiced him.<br><br>

            Even with his newfound homesickness, Pugsley had chosen to run away with Barney. He goes to the park with Barney 
            and ends up sacrificing himself to the demon king for his owner in a time of danger, becoming possessed by the 
            Chieftain of Torment. <br>This does not last long, as Temeluchus' soul is sealed away in a photograph, leaving the 
            dog with only a fraction of his powers.

            Pauline appeared to be a kind and friendly actress at first, and she was a role model to many people, 
            becoming so popular that she was able to open an amusement park dedicated to her.<br><br> In reality, Pauline was selfish, 
            pompous, and daring, which led to her death with an insurance ad tape as evidence. She was manipulative and had Pauline 
            look-alikes to keep her youth and career alive. For example, she lies to and manipulates Courtney in order to find her a new body.
