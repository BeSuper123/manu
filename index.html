            Dead End on Netflix is an animated version of Hamish Steele's DeadEndia series of 
            <br>graphic novels, but the first season of the new program also serves as a brilliant 
            <br>illustration of the wonder LGBTQ creators can do when given the tools and freedom 
            <br>to create their own tales. <br>
            <br>Although the story of wayward youths who find themselves after being drawn into the 
            <br>paranormal activities of a haunted theme park in Dead End is uniquely its own, the 
            <br>fact that it even exists is a tribute to the influence other recent progressive-minded 
            <br>cartoons have had on contemporary animation.</p>

            Netflix's Dead End probably wouldn't exist or be able to be the big-hearted, emotionally 
            <br>sophisticated, all-ages fun that it is without series like Steven Universe, She-Re and 
            <br>the Princesses of Power, and The Owl House.
